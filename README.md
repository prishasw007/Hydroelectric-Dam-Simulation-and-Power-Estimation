# Hydroelectric-Dam-Simulation-and-Power-Estimation
This project involves the planning and simulation of a hydroelectric dam system. Using MATLAB, the project includes creating visualizations of a proposed reservoir, calculating the reservoir volume at various water levels, and estimating the maximum potential power output of the dam. The ultimate goal is to provide accurate data to assist in hydroelectric power generation analysis.

Features
Visualization of Valley and Reservoir
A MATLAB-based 3D visualization of the selected valley and reservoir at different water heights. This uses the provided topographic data to model the landscape and water surface accurately.

Reservoir Volume Calculation
A function that estimates the volume of water in the reservoir at a given water level, with results in millions of cubic meters.

Power Output Estimation
A function to compute the maximum hydroelectric power output based on water height, efficiency, and water flow rate, providing results in gigawatts.

Technologies Used
MATLAB
The project uses MATLAB for data processing, visualization, and simulation. Key MATLAB functionalities include meshgrid generation, 3D surface plotting, and mathematical operations for volume and power calculations.
Installation
Clone the project repository.
Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
project1_data.mat file was provided internally, which contains the valley's topographic data.

Usage
Run Visualization
Use the reservoir_visualization.m function to generate a 3D plot of the reservoir. Pass the water height as a parameter to visualize different water levels.

Calculate Reservoir Volume
Run reservoir_volume.m to estimate the volume of water for a given height.

Estimate Power Output
Use the max_power.m function to compute the maximum power output for given water height, system efficiency, and mass flow rate.

Files
reservoir_visualization.m – Creates a 3D visualization of the reservoir.
reservoir_volume.m – Estimates the volume of water in the reservoir.
max_power.m – Calculates the potential power output of the dam.
